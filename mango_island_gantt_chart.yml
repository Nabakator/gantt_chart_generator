  name: "Mango Island (AORT 2025–26)"

# Design intent:
# - One coherent WBS across ALL sub-teams using the same lifecycle language (Phase A/B/C/D/E).
# - Cross-team dependencies so it reads like one integrated rover programme.
# - Only anchor tasks have explicit start_date; dependent tasks omit start_date so the scheduler infers.
